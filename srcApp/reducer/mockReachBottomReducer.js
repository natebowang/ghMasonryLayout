The decision to restore Cupid to the work was taken after recent laboratory tests established beyond doubt that the figure was overpainted decades after Vermeer completed it."

The same Cupid painting also features in A Lady Standing at a Virginal in the National Gallery in London. Scholars believe it may have been a real picture in Vermeer’s possession: a 1676 inventory of his widow’s belongings includes mention of “a Cupid.”"

The first stage of Schölzel’s work focussed on removing this layer."

An external panel of experts, including Ige Verslype at the Rijksmuseum and Arthur Wheelock at the National Gallery in Washington, is advising on the restoration, which is funded with support from the Hata Foundation in Amsterdam and Tokyo."

Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window will be displayed in its current, semi-restored state from 8 May to 16 June in the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister in the Semperbau in Dresden."

This is however achieved at the cost of limited expressiveness and does not take in global context into account."

In this approach, pose estimation is formulated as a CNN-based regression problem towards body joints. They also use a cascade of such regressors to refine the pose estimates and get better estimates. One important thing this approach does is the reason about pose in a holistic fashion, i.e even if certain joints are hidden, they can be estimated if the pose is reasoned about holistically. The paper argues that CNNs naturally provide this sort of reasoning and demonstrate strong results."

Images are cropped around the predicted joint and fed to the next stage, in this way the subsequent pose regressors see higher resolution images and thus learn features for finer scales which ultimately leads to higher precision."

The output is a discrete heatmap instead of continuous regression. A heatmap predicts the probability of the joint occurring at each pixel. This output model is very successful and a lot of the papers that followed predict heatmaps instead of direct regression."

They do this by using an additional ‘pose refinement’ ConvNet that refines the localization result of the coarse heat-map. However, unlike a standard cascade of models, they reuse existing convolution features. This not only reduces the number of trainable parameters in the cascade but also acts as a regularizer for the coarse heat-map model since the coarse and fine models are trained jointly."

The overall working is pretty straightforward: Predict what is wrong with the current estimates and correct them iteratively. To quote the authors, Instead of directly predicting the outputs in one go, they use a self-correcting model that progressively changes an initial solution by feeding back error predictions, and this process is called Iterative Error Feedback (IEF)."
